# ðŸ¦  Micro-organism Image Classification using DINOv2

This project uses [Meta AI's DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) â€” a self-supervised vision transformer â€” for classifying images of micro-organisms.

## Notebook
- `DinoV2_Image_Classification_CLEAN.ipynb`:  
  A complete pipeline for micro-organism image classification using pretrained DINOv2 features with a custom classifier.

---


## Features

- Uses pretrained **DINOv2 ViT backbone** (e.g., ViT-S, ViT-B).
- Extracts high-dimensional embeddings for images.
- Trains a lightweight classifier (e.g., MLP or Logistic Regression).
- Evaluates performance on unseen data with accuracy and confusion matrix.
